# weather-board
Here is my project where I created a dashboard for seacrhing a weather api that returns various data on each city selected, then the queried cities will save to local storage to be saved on the client. The data returned then displays in various elements such as a 5-day forecast and with  the temperature, windspeed and humidity for each day as well as an image that describes the weather.
